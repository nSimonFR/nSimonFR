# 👋 Hello ! I'm Nicolas

- 🚚 I currently work at [Trusk](https://trusk.com), a transportation and logistics startup _(B2B2C)_, trying to solve lastmile delivery with cool tech
- ☎️ I'm co-founder and co-maker of [Gaston](https://gaston.tel), a SaaS and mobile app that acts as a smart voicemail assistant for busy people
- 👨‍💻 I used to be a freelance developer, innovation consultant, and also gave computer courses and tech support (Still do for relatives 😉)
- ❤️ I love Node, React (Native), Containerization and Tech News ! I tend to tweak and adjust every possible setting I can, as well as participating in testing programs for no reason sometimes _(I like living on the edge 😎)_
- ⭐ I star _a lot_ of repositories across github, as a way to bookmark them 😛
- 📇 Here are my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nSimonFR), [Telegram](https://t.me/nsimon), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nsimonfr) & [Mail](mailto://contact@nsimon.fr) if you want to reach out (I'm based in Paris)

Also, here's [my website](https://nsimon.fr/) and my [CV (🇫🇷)](https://nsimon.fr/Nicolas_SIMON_CV.pdf).
Have a wonderful day !
